					<h2>Enterprise Information Systems Architecture</h2>
					<p>The EISA web site is a central knowledge and content store for Information Technology architecture. The architectural content and processes are
						specific to Intermountain Healthcare and SelectHealth. Information Technology at Intermountain Healthcare has a long-standing tradition for developing
						world class systems. We want to continue this tradition, but with shorter release cycles. This means we will not have all the features we want, but we will
						deliver one or two features every couple of weeks. So please visit back often.</p>
